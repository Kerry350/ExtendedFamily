# Cedric

Cedric is a blue French Lop, he came from the same litter as his brother Jake. Cedric is my fianc√©'s rabbit. Cedric is exceptionally regal and in many ways grumpy; but we love him for it. Cedric has very striking eyes, which when being named linked him to Robert Pattinson, but rather than being named Edward, he was called Cedric (Harry Potter fans will understand this).
